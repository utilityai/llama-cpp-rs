    # Erroneously the llama.cpp code currently generates the build-info.cpp
    # into the source directory of the build instead of into the target directory
    # as it should. Will try submitting something upstream to clean this up as
    # well but for now explictly exclude this from the build. Previously this was
    # implicitly excluded because the llama.cpp code was copied wholesale into the
    # target directory for building which is why this problem wasn't visible before
    # (i.e. we'd package the llama.cpp source from the submodule & thus this build-info.cpp
    # generated file would still be ignored because it would only exist in the separate
    # copy within the target directory. An alternative, if we do want to capture build-info.cpp
    # within the package would be to change the CI task to add `--allow-dirty` to the package
    # command.
