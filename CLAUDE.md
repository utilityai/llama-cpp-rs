# Project Context

When working with this codebase, prioritize readability over cleverness. Ask clarifying questions before making architectural changes.

Keep it simple, be opinionated, follow best practices. Avoid using configurable parameters.

Keep the code beautiful. Always optimize the code for a great developer experience.

Be proactive and fix preexisting issues if you encounter them.

Be uncompromising when it comes to the code quality and architecture. Any compromises, coverage gaps, or quality gaps are not acceptable.

Never make assumptions or guesses about code behavior; always investigate. Always make sure everything works.

## Coding Standards

- Do not inline import paths unless necessary. Prefer to use `use` statements in Rust files instead of inline paths to imported modules. The exception would be `error.rs` type modules that handle lib-level error structs.
- Keep at most a single public struct per Rust module.
- Keep at most a single public function per Rust module (multiple public struct methods are OK).
- Keep module names elegant and clearly readable. The name of the module, or any file, should be enough to determine its contents unambiguously.
- Keep modules structure as flat as possible, avoid logical grouping of modules, instead keep the naming consistent.
- Keep standalone, private functions and structs above the public struct or function that is exported.
- Group the modules by name prefix. For example, `client_foo`, `client_bar`, etc., wherever it makes sense to do so.
- Decide to group the modules based on software architecture, messaging hierarchy, or inheritance. Do not group modules just for the sake of it.
- Maintain a tree-like structure of modules, avoid circular dependencies at all costs. Extract common functions or structs into separate modules, or separate subprojects in the workspace.
- Name files the same way as the struct or function they contain.
- Be explicit, do not use general import statements that involve "*", prefer to import everything explicitly.
- Do not use copy-pasted or copied code in any capacity. If you have issues extracting something into a module, discuss the steps first.
- Keeping slightly different message types, or other kinds of structs that are only slightly different, because of the context they are used in, is fine.
- Each function or method should do just a single thing. The single responsibility principle is really important.
- Always use explicit lifetime variable names (do not use `'a` and such, use descriptive names like `'message` or similar)
- Always use explicit generic parameter names (never use single letter names like `T` for generics, prefix all of them with `T`, however). For example, use `TMessage` instead of `T`, etc.
- Always use descriptive and explicit variable names, even in anonymous functions. Never use single-letter variable names.
- Instead of writing comments that explain what the code does, make the code self-documenting.
- Do not use `pub(crate)` in Rust; in case of doubt, just make things public.
- Add an empty line before return statements that end the function or a method.
- Add an empty line between loops and preceding statements from the same scope.
- Handle all the errors; never ignore them. Make sure the application does not panic.
- In Rust, never ignore errors with `Err(_)`; always make sure you are matching an expected error variant instead.
- Never use `.expect`, or `.unwrap`. In Rust, if a function can fail, use a matching Result (can be from the anyhow crate) instead. In case of doubt on this, ask. Allow `.expect` in mutex lock poison checks, unit tests, or when integrating CPP libraries into Rust, and there is no way to use Result instead.
- Use object-oriented style and composition. Avoid functions that take a struct as a parameter; move it to the struct implementation instead.
- Always make sure mutex locks are held for the shortest possible time.
- Always specify Rust dependencies in root Cargo.toml, then use workspace versions of packages in workspace members.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- Before using vendor crates or modules, make sure they are well-maintained, secure, and documented.
- Always make sure there is only one valid way to do a specific task in the codebase. Make sure everything has a single source of truth.
- In Rust, when implementing `new` method in a struct, prefer to use a struct with parameters list instead of multiple function arguments. It should be easier to maintain.
- Use only the most precise error variants to cover a Result error case. If nothing suitable is available, add a new error variant.

## Unit Tests and Quality Control

- Always check the project with Clippy.
- Always format the code with `cargo fmt`.
- Always check that the unit tests pass.
- Always test the code, make sure tests work after the changes.
- Always write tests that check the algorithms, or meaningful edge cases. Never write tests that check things that can be handled by types instead.
- If some piece of code can be handled by proper types, use types instead. Write tests as a last resort.
- In unit tests, make sure there is always just a single correct way to do a specific thing. Never accept fuzzy inputs from end users.
- When working on tests, if you notice that the tested code can be better, you can suggest changes.
- When running tests, always save output to a temporary file, so you won't need to re-run them to analyze it.

## Quality Checklist

- When dealing with tokens, classifying tokens, analyzing tokens, make sure it happens in a single pass. Do not do separate passes for the sake of performance, architect the pipeline in a way that is readable, easy to maintain, but also streamlined.

## Committing Changes

- Always keep the commit messages short, human readable, descriptive. Keep commit messages as one-liners.
- Do not add any metadata to commits.
- Describe what the changes actually do instead of listing the changed files.
